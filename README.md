# Pomodoro-Clock-Jera-Academy
Working on a pomodoro watch to try to join Jera Academy.
This project was developed and implemented using javascript and html.
In this project I am developing a software for the use of the Pomodoro technique, it is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. 
The technique consists of using a stopwatch to divide the work into periods of 25 minutes, separated by brief intervals. The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks 
can increase mental alertness.
Principles of the Pomodoro Technique
Step-by-step
1-Choose and list the tasks to perform;
2-Adjust the timer for the desired time (usually 25 minutes);
3-Choose the initial task;
4-Work on the chosen task until the alarm sounds. If any major distractions arise, write it down and immediately return the focus back to the task;
5-When the alarm rings, make a marking on a paper to count the amount of intervals.
6-If there are less than 4 markings, take a short break (3-5 minutes);
7-After the fourth appointment, take a longer break (10-30 minutes), zeroing the dial count and returning to step 1.

This project was based on the Freshman tutorial which reused the sound files, html and css and implemented the javascript part following your tutorial on the pomodoro https://freshman.tech/pomodoro-timer/
